CompositeTextAnalyzer
=====================

Text analysis is to support management of large sets of document files.

This project develops a program for making queries into a set of ASCII text files(including Office Word file) with associated metadata. 
The metadata consists of one XML file for each text file and the XML will describe properties of the associated text file. 
So that we can making queries for metadata for each file and searching file by using those tags in the metadata file.

This Composite Text Analyzer contains three main operations: 
1. Fuzzy or exact texts searching 2. Metadata Query and searching 3. Metadata Generator.
The purpose of this text analysis is to support management of large sets of document files. 
It's can be reusable and extensible.

The implementation is using C# and .Net 4.5.
